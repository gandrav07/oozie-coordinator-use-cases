# Release model

We are following a date-driven release model with quarterly releases aligned, roughly, to the calendar quarters. If you're familiar with [Ubuntu's Time Based releases](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases), you will have no problem understanding our model. It is like a train schedule -- if a feature misses a train, the train still leaves on time. No reason to worry. There will be another train in 3 month.
